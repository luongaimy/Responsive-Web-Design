# Responsive-Web-Design
In this project, I learned how to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.

Later, I'll learn modern techniques like CSS variables by building a penguin, and best practices for accessibility by building a quiz site.

Finally, I'll learn how to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes by building a photo gallery with Flexbox, and a magazine article layout with CSS Grid.

### Cat Photo App: 

I built a cat photo app to learn the basics of HTML and CSS: 

*catphotoapp.html*

I learn CSS by designing a menu page for a cafe webpage: 

*cafemenu*
